Notes going forward:

Some eurocontrol objects are shared...
	For example: TimeInterval objects can be found in PointUsage & InstrumentApproachProcedure objects...
Thus, we may want to create seperate table Schemas (and a doc to house them) for these shared objects...

1. TimeSlice objects may need to hold the gmlIdentifier, and codeSpace, then each object would reference the ID and use an autoID for a pk

2. Feature Times need to be added to the schema. (they can differ from the Valid times) 

3. TimeIntervals were made to be their own object. This can now be referenced to a specific table record (object) using the parent 
	object's name and an Integer ID referencing that parent object.
	
* Consider a method of pushing multiple objects, and then have one object that points to them all
	e.g. Tables: A, B, C
		1 of A, zero or many of B...
		A -> C (C_ID, A_ID, B*_ID) -> [B1, B2, B3]...
